# Random Password Generator for Employees


## Description 

With all of the passwords we must create, it becomes increasingly difficult to generate new passwords that are both unique and secure. As a result, I was inspired to create a random password generator for employees. I created this project to address the problem of creating a password that protects employees from security issues. This application allows the user to specify the length of the passwor, as well as, the characters they'd like to include. Lastly, this project allowed me to put my newly acquired JavaScript skills to use!


## Installation 

N/A

## Usage 

Users can access my password generator by clicking on the following link: https://lgenzone.github.io/password-generator/ 

After navigating to my password generator webpage, click "Generate Password" to begin. The page will then ask a series of questions regarding criteria for the user's password. First the page will ask the user how long they'd like the password to be. Next, the page will ask questions regarding which characters to use. The user selects "Ok" for yes, and "Cancel" for no. After completing each of the required questions, the generated password will appear in the box above "Generate Password".
